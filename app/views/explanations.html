	<h4 id="overview"> Overview of privacy threats </h4>




	<h4 id="disclosure"> Disclosure of information </h4>

	<p>The risk of identifiable information being available on the web is principally due to three sources: the internet users who willingly release information, the service providers who had the information and leaked or sold it and external third parties who invaded computer systems illegally. The paragraphs below will expand on each of them.</p>
	<p>To begin with, the user can willingly choose to release information on the web. For instance, this could happen while publishing posts and sharing news with others on a social network website. As a matter of fact, the benefits gained by releasing those information such as communicating with friends than they cannot see as they used to is enough to persuade them to disclose information on the internet. Depending on the privacy value protecting that information, a certain audience will have access to its content whether it is a post or information in a profile. Online purchases and online banking are other examples of online activities with a risk of disclosure of information since they require entrusting sensitive information such as credentials, passwords and payment information such as credit card details. In any case, personally identifiable information is often asked by the organizations in order to be able to consume the service and, like any data generated by the consumer, this data is entrusted and stored by the service provider or by a trustable third party in charge of keeping it safe (e.g. eTrust and storage specialised companies). </p>
	<p>The second source of leak is the private industry sector which makes tremendous benefits from this and from the increasing technical capability of information systems (Bughin et al., 2009). By exploiting other information unconsciously generated or provided by the user without his knowledge or consent and with other ways to track the habits of the user such as cookies, pixels and local storage (Facebook, 2014), the organizations can build a profile of the consumers. Firstly, this allows them to understand their tastes and habits better and to use that information to manipulate the customers. For instance, Facebook and Amazon record the behaviour of their users and analyze their every data in their possession (e.g. last purchases, psychological character, tastes and habits) in order to predict their actions or identify them in a category of individuals. This allows them to display advertisements and send mails which are very likely to interest their customers and incite them to buy or subscribe to one of their products. Secondly, this data has a commercial value (Christiansen, 2011) since some companies do not have the means to collect the data but are still interested in them. So, the one possessing the data can take advantage of it and sell the information to other companies interested in the data or by sharing it with a partner for instance. Both cases reflect the increasing interest organizations have into Big Data since it helps them improve their benefits. Indeed, the volume of data gathered those two last year exponentially increased according to the study (EPIC, 2014) led by EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) which also claims 90 percent of the data currently available in the world was generated during those past two years. This volume is so enormous that it is now being measured in petabytes (1 petabyte = one million gigabytes) and this brings us to the third source of potential leaks of information.</p>
	<p>The security measures applied to the system holding the information determines its safety against third parties with ill intents. Indeed, a research led by Ponemon Institute (Pagliery, 2014) estimated the number of hacked online accounts to 432 million. This number mainly consists of 110 million Target consumers who had their credit card and personal data exposed, 148 million eBay users who had their credentials stolen and of 4.6 million Snapshot users who had their personally identifying information including partial phone numbers stolen as well. This recent numbers of data breaches is so important compared to the past years that Jose Pagliery qualifies 2014 of “the year of the hack” (Pagliery, 2014). Moreover, the breaches are not necessarily coming from an external third party such as a hacker breaking through the security of the computer systems. In fact, Furnell and Thompson (2009) theorize the employees of a company themselves can be an obstacle to effective maintenance of information security. “Accidental disclosure, insider curiosity, insider subordination, security defects, scams, and uncontrolled secondary usage of personal data” (Dinev et al, 2008) are all situations which compromise the data that was entrusted to the organizations which stored the information and was supposed to keep the data safe. In addition, the fact that this data could be stolen without the knowledge of the consumers and of the company is even more frightening since an impostor could freely use that information. For instance, the credit card details stolen could be used to pay products until the owner notices it, it will be too late already since the damage is already dealt. Hence, each incident endangers the safety of the owner of the information and raises the risk of impostors posing as the consumer. </p>
	<p>Finally, the European Commission DG Justice mentions an empirical study (Acquisti et al., 2006) which “suggests the cost of reputation loss (in terms of stock market impact) following incidents of data loss is relatively low and dissipates quickly” (The European Commission DG Justice, 2010) for large enterprises. Still, according to Acquisti et al. (Acquisti et al., 2006), privacy incidents resulted in an average loss of 7.4 million Euros in market value in 2006. Since their reputation is at stake, appropriate measures to satisfy their customers should be adopted. For example, eBay had to change its security measures when the credentials of their customers were stolen (Pagliery, 2014). That is especially true for small companies which may not recover from the decrease of sales.</p>



	<h4 id="profiling"> Profiling</h4>

	<p>Profiling consists in “reconstructing a person's movements or transactions over a specific period of time, usually in order to become better acquainted with a person's more private affairs” (Electronic Foundation Frontier, 2014). This was rendered possible to apply on a large public due to smart devices being developed and accessible to the general public over the past few years. Indeed, many ways were also invented to track the movements of individuals and for instance, various daily tools are now equipped with a location tracking unit amongst their components (e.g. smartphones, cars, watches, Google Glass...). This allows the owner to know the whereabouts of the device if it is stolen or lost. However, if the owner always carries this device, it enables other individuals and companies to profile him/her as well. Indeed, with the data gathered on the patterns of the owner’s daily movements, it is possible for them to build up the profile of an individual (e.g. errands, habits, personal health histories, work hours and current and previous locations…) and to use them for their own benefits again as mentioned in the section "Disclosure of information". </p>
	<p>Another way to get similar information is to analyze contents uploaded by the consumer. For instance, it is possible to learn when and where a picture was taken thanks to the EXIF data attached to it which can contain the location information if the picture was taken with a tool capable of getting that information. That is also the principle behind the features of the geolocation OSINT tool ‘Creepy’ (Kakavas, 2014) which downloads and extracts the EXIF data from the pictures, posts and tweets published by the user with the APIs of three online sources: Twitter, Instagram and Flickr. For this, only the username of the target or his/her mail, id or full name are required. Hence, even if the information is less accurate than having a GPS unit recording the geolocation, uploading pictures or posting messages on a social network offer the service provider additional information on the consumer again. The availability of such information fosters the risk of location disclosure and stalking/cyberstalking.</p>
	<p>It is possible to prevent the device from sending the geolocation of the owner. “Android’s location tracking is an opt-in feature” (Gordon, 2011) which means it is possible to completely deactivate it for Android devices. Nevertheless, deactivating the location tracking on a device is not always possible. In the case of Apple devices for example, it becomes more complicated. In fact, the user can deactivate the location services, i.e. the device stop sending information to the applications and other third parties which normally request it. Nonetheless, the device actually continues to cache the geolocation of its owner; therefore it is still possible to track the movements of its owner. Then, when plugged into a machine with iTunes installed, the information is synchronized and the geolocation recorded by the tool are sent to Apple as well. In order to stop this caching completely, there are means but, as they do not align with the policy of Apple, it requires the jailbreak of the device and the installation of the ‘Untrackerd’ application (Gordin, 2011). </p>



	<h4 id="surveillance"> Government surveillance</h4>

	<p>Each country has a different politic adopts its own position regarding the privacy of its citizens. The government agencies (e.g. law enforcement agencies) exert a through surveillance over the citizens of their respective country as well. This practice is frequently used to gather intelligence to detect and prevent security breaches, fraud and other crimes (e.g. hacking, internet transactions fraud and advertising of illegal products), and terrorist activities (Dinev et al., 2008). Nevertheless, all internet users do not share this point of view and some privacy specialists even consider that as an abuse of their authority. In fact, this surveillance involves secretly monitoring individuals over their own networks. As a result, the government agencies know which websites the individual visited and are able to ask companies and services providers to hand them down every information in their possession including private communications. This is especially true with the U.S. government which reinforced its security and privacy policy since the terrorist attack of the September 11th which caused the public sector to fear privacy vulnerabilities amongst many other concerns (Dinev et al., 2008). </p>
	<p>According to a study (Wills and Zeljkovic, 2011), 63% of U.S. internet users are concerned by third parties monitoring activities. The European Commission published similar results (Newman and Andreeva, 2011) amongst European internet users the same year. By comparing them, we can observe equal or greater level of worries regarding privacy issues from European internet users on various questions. </p>
	<p>The Snowden affair (Oltermann, 2013), which occurred in the United Kingdom, enhanced the awareness of government surveillance by openly revealing to the public the fact that law enforcement agencies and especially NSA are freely spying on phone and internet communications. This includes data stored on the cloud via storage providers like Dropbox or Google which means law enforcement agencies can have access to the data entrusted by the consumer. That is why using online services means that the law enforcement agencies can access anything they put on the Web and that protecting one’s privacy while using the internet is almost impossible even for a very meticulous person. Assuming the Snowden affair affected the point of view of individuals who were not aware of the surveillance of the governments, the percentage of concerned internet users probably increased compared to the study mentioned before (Newman and Andreeva, 2011). This means the numbers of individuals potentially interested keeping personal information online safe from everybody else including the government and therefore in the solutions proposed by this study presumably grew too. </p>
